Tiny C++ server for TCP and HTTP 1.1 connections. [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv) empowers asynchronous IO.

Simple native building on Unix **TODO**:

    build.sh

Or on Windows **TODO**:

    build.bat

Goal is to support 3 platforms: Linux, Mac, Windows. And compilers: Clang, GCC, MSVC.

Small compiled core and header-only addons for server. No plans for HTTP2/SPDY-support. May be SSL-encryption.
